## Color Palette
Based on color psychology for connection platforms helping people with loneliness and depression:
- Primary Gradient: Soft Sage Green (#a8d5ba) to Mint Green (#7ec8a3) - promotes calm, growth, and balance
- Secondary Gradient: Airy Sky Blue (#b3e5fc) to Aqua Blue (#81d4fa) - conveys trust, serenity, and peace
- Accent Gradient: Light Peach (#ffe0b2) to Warm Peach (#ffcc80) - adds optimism and warmth

The colors create a calming, nature-inspired, uplifting backdrop that promotes stability and well-being.
